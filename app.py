example_question = "Here's a detailed Python question about for loops for a beginner level:\n Question: \n Write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to a given positive integer, n. The program should use a for loop to iterate over the numbers and add up the even ones. Finally, it should print the total sum. \n Example: \n If the input value of n is 10, the program should calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive), which are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The sum of these numbers is 30, so the program should output: \n Example code: \n The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is 30. \n Your task is to write the Python code to solve this problem using a for loop. Good luck!"
